C_HW8
=====

For this assignment, you are to extend your hw6 with file saving and restoration capability.
Upon opening, your program should attempt to read the ".events" file from your current directory.  
Note that in Unix-like shells, file names that begin with the "." character are not displayed by "ls", unless you do "ls -a". If the .events file does not exist, then your program proceeds normally; 
if it does, then it reads the events that have been saved from the previous session.
